# hello-world
My first repository!


I am "Sheris016526". There is significance in the number 016526, but only if you know what WHQ and discernment mean. I am new to GitHub. I am new to all of this. I am considering myself a "Future Self-Taught Developer". I have goals. I also have coffee. That means I can pretty much do anything.
